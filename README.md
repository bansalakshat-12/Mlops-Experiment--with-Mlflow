MLOps Experimentation with MLflow
Overview

This repository focuses on experiment tracking and model management using MLflow as part of a modern MLOps workflow.
The project demonstrates how machine learning experiments can be tracked, compared, versioned, and reproduced in a production-style environment.

It is designed for hands-on MLOps practice and interview readiness for AI Engineer / MLOps Engineer roles.

Objectives

Log parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models

Compare multiple experiment runs

Practice reproducible ML workflows

Understand model versioning and lifecycle management

Key Concepts Covered
